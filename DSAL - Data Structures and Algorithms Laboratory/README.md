**DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS LABORATORY PRACTICALS LIST**

**EXPERIMENT 1**
Beginning with an empty binary tree, construct binary tree by inserting the values in
the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations on it-
•Perform inorder, preorder and post order traversal
•Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every
node
•Find the height of tree
•Copy this tree to another [operator=]
•Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes.
•Erase all nodes in a binary tree. (Implement both recursive and non-recursive methods)

**EXPERIMENT 2**
A dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords, 
deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display
whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. Also find how many maximum
comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use Binary Search Tree for implementation.

**EXPERIMENT 3**
Create an inordered threaded binary search tree. Perform inorder, preorder traversals
without recursion and deletion of a node. Analyze time and space complexity of the
algorithm.

**EXPERIMENT 4**
Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table implementation to quickly look up client‘s telephone number. 
Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons 
required to find a set of telephone numbers 
(Note: Use linear probing with replacement and without replacement)

**EXPERIMENT 5**
Implement all the functions of a dictionary (ADT) using open hashing technique: separate chaining using linked list Data: 
Set of (key, value) pairs, Keys are mapped to values, Keys must be comparable, and Keys must be unique. 
Standard Operations: Insert(key, value), Find(key), Delete(key)
Group C

**EXPERIMENT 6**
Represent a given graph using adjacency list to perform DFS and BFS. Use the map of
the area around the college as the graph. Identify the prominent land marks as nodes
and perform DFS and BFS on that.

**EXPERIMENT 7**
You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect
them up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money
to connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. 
Solve the problem by suggesting appropriate data structures.

**EXPERIMENT 8**
Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … <kn of n sorted keys, with a successful and 
unsuccessful search probability pi and qi for each key ki. 
Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access 
probability for each key.

**EXPERIMENT 9**
A Dictionary stores keywords and its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords. 
Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order.
Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword.
Use Height balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

**EXPERIMENT 10**
Implement the Heap sort algorithm demonstrating heap data structure with modularity
of programming language

**EXPERIMENT 11**
Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. 
Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular employee. 
If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. 
If it is, then the system displays the student details. Use sequential
file to maintain the data

**EXPERIMENT 12**
Implementation of a direct access file -Insertion and deletion of a record from a direct
access file
